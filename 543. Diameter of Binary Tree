# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# Example:
# Given a binary tree
#           1
#          / \
#         2   3
#        / \     
#       4   5

    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:

        def helper(root):
            if not root:
                return 0 
            L = helper(root.left)
            R = helper(root.right)
            self.ans = max(self.ans, L+R+1)
            lent = max(L, R)+1
            return lent

        helper(root)
        return self.ans -1
