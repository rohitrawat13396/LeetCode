# 134. Gas Station
# There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

# You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

# Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

# Note:

# If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
# Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
# Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
