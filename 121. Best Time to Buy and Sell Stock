# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

# Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
#              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        #Method0. Buy every element and sell the max of the rest O(n^2)
        # max_profit = 0
        # for i in range(len(prices)-1):
        #     max_profit = max(max_profit,max(prices[i+1:])-prices[i])
        # return max_profit
        
        #Method1. Maintaining minimum_price and max_profit
        if not prices:
            return 0
        min_price = prices[0]
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            min_price = min(prices[i], min_price)
            max_profit = max(prices[i]-min_price, max_profit)
        return max_profit
