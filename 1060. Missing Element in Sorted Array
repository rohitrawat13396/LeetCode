# 1060. Missing Element in Sorted Array

# Given a sorted array A of unique numbers, find the K-th missing number starting from the leftmost number of the array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: A = [4,7,9,10], K = 1
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# The first missing number is 5.
# Example 2:

# Input: A = [4,7,9,10], K = 3
# Output: 8
# Explanation: 
# The missing numbers are [5,6,8,...], hence the third missing number is 8.
# Example 3:

# Input: A = [1,2,4], K = 3
# Output: 6
# Explanation: 
# The missing numbers are [3,5,6,7,...], hence the third missing number is 6.

class Solution:
    def missingElement(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        i =0
        while k and (i+1)<len(nums):
            dif = nums[i+1] - nums[i]
            if k >= dif:
                k -= (dif-1)
            else:
                return nums[i]+k
            i +=1
        return nums[-1]+k
