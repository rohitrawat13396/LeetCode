# 692. Top K Frequent Words

# Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

# Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

# Example 1:
# Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
# Output: ["i", "love"]
# Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
#     Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
