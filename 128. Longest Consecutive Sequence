# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

# Example:

# Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
    
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        
        
        nums = set(nums)        # takes O(n)
        # print(nums)
        final_streak = 0
        for n in nums:
            print(n)
            if n-1 not in nums:
                current_streak = 1
                
                while n+1 in nums:
                    current_streak +=1
                    n +=1
                final_streak = max(final_streak, current_streak)
        return final_streak
