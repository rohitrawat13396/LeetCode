# 441. Arranging Coins

# You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

# Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

# n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.


class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n<=1:
            return n
        
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            # print("i,n",i,n)
            if i<=n:
                n -=i
            else:
                return i-1
            
#         solution 2: faster   
#         return int((-1 + sqrt(1 + 8*n)) // 2)
        
#         int>>floor
