# 973. K Closest Points to Origin
# We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

# (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

# You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)


class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        #Method 0. sorted method  in O(NlogN) but for worst case scenario O(N^2)
        # return sorted(points, key = lambda x: sqrt(x[0]**2 + x[1]**2))[:K]  
        
        #Method1. Using Heapq in O(log(k)*N + k*logk) 
        return [x[1] for x in heapq.nsmallest(K, [(p[0]**2 + p[1]**2, p) for p in points])]
